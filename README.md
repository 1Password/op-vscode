# 1Password for VS Code

1Password for VS Code provides you with a set of tools to integrate your development workflow with 1Password, powered by the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli).

## Quick start

‚ö°Ô∏è This quick start guide will get you up and running with the extension.

1. **Set up the CLI** - v2.4.0 or greater of the 1Password CLI needs to be [installed on your system](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started#install).
2. **Enable biometric unlock** - You must have [biometric unlock](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/about-biometric-unlock) enabled. If you don't have a biometric device, you'll still be able to use your device user password.
3. **Install the extension** - From the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=1Password.op-vscode) or [GitHub](https://github.com/1Password/op-vscode/releases) install the latest version of the extension.
4. **Follow the prompts** - You'll be prompted to choose a 1Password account and vault. Follow these prompts to finish setup of the extension.

You're all set. Learn more about what the extension is capable of by checking out the [developer portal documentation](https://developer.1password.com/docs/vscode/).
